At the moment, my account and the majority of its repositories are being run, created, organized, and documented with nobody else in mind except my present self. 
Additionally, even if some pieces did have other people in mind, all of the code here should be treated as if nobody else was considered.
In particular this means:
- There is very little documentation or explanation
- The code is not expected to be run at all after my personal intended use-case has concluded or I lose interest (95+% of the time this means <1 month)
- The organization and execution is specific to my personal workflow in that moment so generality, reproducability, and explainability are ignored
- Nothing here should be used for anything of value without a review thorough enough so as to make the end product essentially your own code
